# ðŸ§¶ Velocity Planner
The velocity planner is designed to take in fixed global waypoints from a map, and the current world state (vehicle location, detected obstacles, detected traffic signals) and alter the velocities of the waypoints as required.

## Requirements

- [Ubuntu 20.04](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop)
- [ROS2 Foxy Fitzroy](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Installation.html)
- [mcav_interfaces](https://github.com/Monash-Connected-Autonomous-Vehicle/mcav_interfaces)
- A colcon workspace (assumed to be at `~/colcon_ws`). See the [Creating a Workspace](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Tutorials/Workspace/Creating-A-Workspace.html) tutorial

## Installation

- Go to the `src` directory: `cd ~/colcon_ws/src`
- Clone the source code: `git clone `
- Go to the root of the workspace: `cd ~/colcon_ws`
- Build: `colcon build --symlink-install velocity_planner`

## Usage
### Inputs
- current location (`geometry_msgs/Pose` on topic `/planner/current_pose`)
- global waypoints (`mcav_interfaces/msg/WaypointArray` on topic `/planner/global_waypoints`)

### Outputs
- Array of upcoming waypoints beginning at the point closest to the vehicle (`mcav_interfaces/msg/WaypointArray` on topic `/planner/local_waypoints`)
### Run the planner
- `cd ~/colcon_ws && . install/setup.bash`
- `ros2 launch velocity_planner velocity_planner.launch.py`

### Visualise global and local waypoints
- `ros2 run velocity_planner waypoint_visualiser`
- `rviz2 -d planner.rviz`

### Test using fake global waypoints
- `ros2 run velocity_planner fake_waypoint_publisher`

### Test using waypoints from a csv file
- `ros2 run velocity_planner waypoint_reader town01_small_waypoints.csv`

## Example run 
Shows planner stopping for a detected object
